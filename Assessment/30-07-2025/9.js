// Question 9 : Code
// Answer : 53

var x = "5";
var y = 3;
console.log(`The addition of x and y is : ${x+y}`);

//          The x is a string data type and the y is numeric data type.
//          But if we use addition arithmatic operator for adding stirng and number the number will convert into string while adding.
//          So, The output will be 5 as string + 3 as string = 53 as string.
